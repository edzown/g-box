# G-box Generator

This is a simple React app that generates G-box results. Useful for raffles.

## Features

- Formatting of the final message with formatting codes, BBCodes, or anything else that you wish to add. It also features placeholder values.
- Textbox where you can edit the results, if you wanted to.
- Can generate an absurd number of results, for any value of money (I hope).
